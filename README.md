# beam_stress

Repository has copy of matlab script I wrote to anayze the loading on a circular shaft and display shear and bending moment diagrams, stress at all points of interest, and Factor of Safety. I am working on getting it to be functional for beams of different cross sections and for applied distributed loads.
